hi, this is just a small project to learn about JavaFX and understanding how it works.

calculator.fxml was built with scene builder by gluon.

calculatorcontroller.java was coded with reference to https://github.com/joiro/javaFX-Calculator/blob/master/src/application/MainViewController.java
as i am not sure how to begin.

app.java largely remained the same as when the project was initialised with its template. 

i only added an override method for init so as to understand about the threads when the app is being runned.

this project was initialised on vscode as a javafx project using maven.

completed 15/11/2024
